# Exercise 4: Apply API policies and revisions

In this exercise we will protect an API from abuse by applying a throttling policy. We will also leverage revisions in API Management to make the change in a safe manner as well as provide helpful lifecycle management features.

This may also be an opportunity to explore the Visual Studio Code extension for API Management and learn its capabilities.

## What are Revisions in API Management

Revisions provide a mechanism for making changes to your APIs without disrupting the developers who consume them. With revisions, we can document and try our changes to APIs in a secure manner and then promote those changes when they are ready. APIs can have multiple revisions, which allows us to rollback changes if necessary.

Learn more about [revisions in Azure API Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-revisions).

## Why use policies in API Management

In Azure API Management, policies are a powerful capability that allows API publisher to change the behavior of APIs - while processing requests or responses. Popular policies include format conversion from XML to JSON, rate limiting to restrict the amount of incoming calls, validation of JWT tokens or certificates to secure APIs, caching to accelerate API calls, CORS to allow cross-origin resource sharing, and more. API Management comes with around 45 built-in policies, which can be further extended with policy expressions - snippets of C# code.

Learn about policies in [the official Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-policies), [browse the available policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-policies), and [understand the policy expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-policy-expressions).

## Steps

### Create a new revision

Before introducing non-breaking changes, we will create a new revision. This will allow us to try the changes without affecting any of the consumers.

1. Navigate to your API Management service in the Azure portal.
1. Go to **APIs** and select an existing API.
1. Click the **Revisions** tab from the menu and select **+ Add revision**.
1. Provide a description and click the **Create** button.

### Apply and test the `rate-limit` policy

With the new revision selected, we can apply a `rate-limit` policy to protect our API from abnormal usage. We will limit the number of API calls to 3 per 15s per API subscription key.

1. Confirm that the new revision has been selected from the menu bar.
1. Apply the following `rate-limit` policy on your API (all operations level):

    ```XML
       <rate-limit calls="3" renewal-period="15" />
    ```

    Check the ["Protect an API by adding rate limit policy (throttling)"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/transform-api#protect-an-api-by-adding-rate-limit-policy-throttling) section of the official "Protect your API" tutorial for more precise steps.

    Note: use the `rate-limit` policy; `rate-limit-by-key` isn't available in the Consumption tier.

1. Follow the steps from the ["Test the rate limit (throttling)" section](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/transform-api#test-the-rate-limit-throttling) to test the throttling policy.

1. Follow the steps from the ["Make your revision current and add a change log entry"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-get-started-revise-api#make-your-revision-current-and-add-a-change-log-entry) section to make the new revision the current one.

### Explore Visual Studio Code extension

You can also apply policies in Visual Studio Code, using [API Management's Visual Studio Code extension](https://aka.ms/apim/vscext). Refer to the ["Garnish and serve your APIs in 45 minutes with Azure API Management" session recording](https://youtu.be/bik8JJVNNmk?t=264) for an example of applying rate-limit policy in Visual Studio Code and stress-testing it with the Artillery script. Visual Studio Code extension also lets you debug policies in real time and configure other settings of your API Management service.
