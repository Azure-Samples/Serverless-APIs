# Exercise 6: Publish a new version

In this exercise, you will create and publish a new version of an API in Azure API Managmement.

Versions are often used when breaking changes are introduced to an API. Some examples that validate new versions may include:

- Changes in the format of the response for one or more operations
- Removal of operations or other key components
- Changes in the response type of an operation
- Released-based versions, such as **alpha** or **beta**, that are available for a limited time

## Steps

### Create a new version

1. Navigate to your API Management service in the Azure portal.
1. Go to **APIs** and select an existing API.
1. Open the context menu (...) next to the API and select **+ Add version**.
1. Follow the steps from the ["Choose a versioning scheme"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-get-started-publish-versions#choose-a-versioning-scheme) section of the official "Add multiple versions" tutorial to configure the scheme.

### Associate the version with a product

You can associate an API version with products at the time the version is created, or at a later time if necessary. To associate an API with products after the creation of a version, follow these steps:

1. Select **Products** from the menu of your API Management instance in the Azure portal.
1. Select one of the existing products in the list.
