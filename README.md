# Serverless APIs in Azure - workshop

This repository contains a set of entry-level exercises, which cover the basics of building and managing serverless APIs in Microsoft Azure - with Azure Functions, Azure API Management, and Azure Application Insights.

After completing the workshop, you will be able to:

- Understand and articulate benefits of using API management and API gateway solutions in serverless architectures
- Expose serverless services as APIs in Azure API Management
- Protect, accelerate, and transform APIs with runtime policies
- Observe the API traffic and identify problems across all layers of the stack
- Evolve your APIs with versions, without breaking client applications
- ... and more!

## Repository contents

This repository contains source code of a sample serverless API implemented with Azure Functions as well as six exercises:

1. [Setting up the Azure environment](./readme/1%20-%20Provision%20Azure%20resources.md)
1. [Exposing Functions as APIs in API Management](./readme/2%20-%20Import%20APIs.md)
1. [Packaging APIs with Products](./readme/3%20-%20Products.md)
1. [Applying API runtime policies](./readme/4%20-%20apply%20policies%20and%20revisions.md)
1. [Monitoring APIs with Application Insights](./readme/5%20-%20Monitoring.md)
1. [Versioning APIs](./readme/6%20-%20Versions.md)

The exercises require minimal knowledge of programming. Each exercise contains references to additional resources, such as documentation, blog posts, or conference session recordings.
